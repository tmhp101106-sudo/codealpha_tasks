### 1. About the Project:
  - Basic algorithmic thinking
  - Conditional logic
  - Handling user input
  - Running loops
  - Using functions to structure code
  - Random selection and game design
  - Simple conversational logic

### 2. Features of the project:
#### a. Chatbot:
- Responds to basic greetings and conversational texts such as hello, hi, how are you?, bye.
- Beginner friendly and interactive.

#### b. Hangman:
- Generates random words from a list of words.
- Beginner friendly and interactive.
- Flexible.
- Tracks the number of attempts left and gives the guessed letters in each guess.
  
### 3. Technologies used:
  - VisualStudio code.
  - Python.
  - Github.
  
### 4. Installation and running the project:
  1. Framing a basic algorithm for the chatbot and the hangman game.
  2. Install VS code.
  3. Install the latest version of python.
  4. Type the code, then compile and run it.

### 5. Future improvements:
  I plan to add several more conversational texts and add a GUI for the chatbot and add 
  difficulty level and scoring systems.
